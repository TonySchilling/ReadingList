# ReadingList
This is a simple app that allows users to create and save a reading list.

Users can add new books to the list, storing the book's title, author, number of pages and whether or not the user has finished reading the book. 
Users can also save the reading list, making it available in local storage, as well as clear the reading list (which will also remove it from local storage)

This was a sort exercise with the goal of practicing several concepts:
-Saving/referencing local storage
-Using Bootstrap
-Working with objects
